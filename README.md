# Python-Crash-Course-Bootcamp

This bootcamp, which is based on a book titled "Python Crash Course", that I joined in June 2019.

### Setup

Python 3.7 is in use, and I put all the generated results in a folder

    ./results/

You should create that folder by issue `mkdir results` before running the scripts to prevent errors.

### Remarks

1. I put the reading notes in my Evernote.
2. Keeping things simple, I put examples & exercises of each chapter in a file. One chapter, one `.py` file.
   1. The code of examples & exercises in `.py` files here might not as same as which in the book originally. That is, I might have my idea on coding examples & exercises.
3. Since I don't make `requirements.txt`, please read error messages of required libraries when you run the scripts.
